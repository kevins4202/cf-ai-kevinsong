# AI Prompts Used

This document contains the AI prompts used during development. AI was primarily used for repetitive tasks, formatting, and boilerplate code, while core integration and architecture decisions were handled manually.

## Key Prompts

**UI Components:** Update the Frontend UI to accommodate the new passkey input and creation features, with passkey creation available at any time and chat history saving functionality.

**User Features:** Add a logout button so multiple users can create passkeys, and display the passkey so users can save it with appropriate instructions.

**Code Cleanup:** Refactor the index.ts file to separate the logic for storage, types, and utils, and add minimal comments where needed.

**Documentation:** Create a minimal README for the vacation planner application with only essential information.
